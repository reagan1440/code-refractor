## description
For this asssingment I was instructed to alter existing code for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. This was to be done to meet accesability standards, and leave the repository with cleaner code

### changes in code 

tags such as 
- 'header'
- 'nav'
- 'figure'
 etc were replaced
Hero image was moved from the css file to the HTML 
condensed css file to clean up the code
